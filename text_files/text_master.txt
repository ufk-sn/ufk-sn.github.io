During my graduate studies, I focused on the seismic response of concrete gravity dams. In my thesis, the fragility curves of concrete gravity dam were obtained to make a risk assessment. Also, I published an article about the effect of biaxial stress state on seismic fragility of concrete gravity dams. These experiences provided me with a comprehensive understanding of dam behavior under earthquake loads.
