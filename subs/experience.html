    <!-- <h3>Experiences</h3> -->
    <p>I graduated from Zonguldak Karaelmas University, TR with a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering in 2013.
        Following this, I was awarded a prestigious full scholarship from the Turkish Government to study abroad, and 
        I earned my master's degree in structural engineering from Louisiana State University in 2018. My research 
        focused on the probabilistic risk assessment of concrete gravity dams subjected to earthquake loads. I used Finite 
        Element Analysis software, ANSYS, to model the dam, considering fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and soil-
        structure interaction (SSI) for more accurate results. Finally, seismic fragility curves were developed to 
        evaluate the dam's seismic performance and make risk assessment.</p>
        <br>
    <p>I gained five years of valuable experience working for the Department of Dams and Hydropower Plants in the State 
        Hydraulic Works of Turkey (DSI)—the leading institution in the country for hydraulic works. During my time at DSI,
         I had the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge from my graduate studies to solve real-world problems in 
         the active dam projects. My role involved the structural and hydraulic design of spillways and outlet works.</p>
        <br>
    <p>I was a responsible for checking stability analyses and structural designs reports 
        for auxiliary structures associated with dams, encompassing spillways, their gravity/console retaining walls, conduits, tunnels,
         valve chambers, and similar components. Through these rigorous analyses, I have acquired substantial expertise in
          stability analysis techniques for retaining walls, as well as in structural analysis and the design of 
          reinforcements for various types of structures. Since Turkey does not have a design code/standards for 
          infrastructures like dams, we mainly rely on the design standards set by the USBR or the USACE for our structures.
           This familiarity underscores my capability to adapt to the U.S. standards.</p>
        <br>

    <p>I have also conducted hydraulic design analyses for spillways and outlet works to determine their size, type, and
         placement. Furthermore, I participated in a team tasked with conducting hydraulic analysis of stepped and chute
          channeled spillways using Flow-3D (CFD software) and constructing physical models of them in the laboratory.
           These experiences provided me with a comprehensive understanding of spillway-outlet works hydraulic performance.</p>
        <br>

    <p>Besides working in office, I have participated in several substantial/final acceptance commissions to inspect 
        the constructed dams and auxiliary structures for compliance with the project. Furthermore, for six months I 
        played an important role during the construction stage of flood protection structures, such as flood protection
         walls and dikes, serving as a control engineer.</p>
        <br>
        
    <p>Now, I am eager to take the next step in my career by working in the US. </p>
